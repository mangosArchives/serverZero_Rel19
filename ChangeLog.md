0.18.1 (2013-11-02)
-------------------
Major changes for this build which require your attention when upgrading include
awesome things such as these:

* The *mangos-zero* build system has been overhauled, and we are now using CMake
  only. For Linux and FreeBSD users this means you can *always* use packages as
  provided by your distribution, and for Windows users this means you'll now
  have to download and install dependencies just once.
  We recommend that our Windows users pick up pre-built dependencies from
  [GNUWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/).
* The tools for map extraction and generation from the game client are finally
  first class citizens when you build *mangos-zero*, and will be built, too.
* The `genrevision` application has been removed from the build. Revision data
  and build information is now extracted via [Git](http://git-scm.com/) only.
* SOAP bindings for the world server are now optional, and will be disabled by
  default when building *mangos-zero*. If you need them, there is a CMake switch
  available to enable the bindings.
* The output given by all map tools has been cleaned up, and will now give you
  useful information such as the map version, or complete usage instructions.
  Pass the `--help` parameter, and any map tool will provide usage instructions!
* Documentation has been rewritten and converted to **Markdown** format, which
  is readable and converts nicely to HTML when viewing in the repository browser.
* Documentation has been added for all map tools including usage instructions
  and examples.
* Player movement has been rewritten, and now factors in possible issues such as
  lag when sending out character movement. This also means, looting when moving
  is no longer possible, and will be canceled.
* Looting in groups has been corrected, and you should now be able to use round
  robin, master looter, free for all and need before greed looting.
* EventAI is now more verbose, and will validate targets for commands upon server
  start-up. It's very likely that you will see many more errors now. Additionally
  the `npc aiinfo` command will display more useful info.
* **ScriptDev2** has been merged into the server repository! You do not need to
  make a clone, and *may need to delete* previously checkouts of the scripts
  repository. This also means, *ScriptDev2* will now always be built when you
  build the *mangos-zero* server.

Also numerous minor fixes and improvements have been added, such as:

* Using potions for power types not used by a class will now raise the correct
  error messages, e.g. Warriors can no longer consume Mana potions.
* Hunter pets will receive full experience when their masters are grouped.
* Mobs fleeing will do so now in normal speed, instead of crazy speed.
* The world server will now provide improved, readable output on start-up, and
  less confusing messages for identical issues.
* In-game commands `goname` and `namego` have been replaced with `appear` and
  `summon`. If you happen to find other commands with weird naming, let us know!
* We have done extensive house-keeping and removed many TBC specific code parts,
  and replaced TBC specific values with the proper vanilla WoW counterparts.
  This includes the TBC spell modifiers, which now have been dropped and are no
  longer available.
* Unprivileged player accounts will no longer be able to execute mangos dot
  commands in the in-game chat. If you need this, enable `PlayerCommands` in
  the mangosd configuration. The default setting is off.

0.18.0 (2013-08-31)
-------------------
Major changes for this build which require your attention when upgrading include
awesome things such as these:

* A build fix for FreeBSD has been added, thanks to @bels. *mangos-zero* should
  now successfully build again.
* In-game channels *Local defense* and zone channels no longer have characters as
  owners.
* Creature emotes have been fixed, and work again.
* Weather updates for zones without any defined weather have been fixed. A zone
  without weather will no longer cause the client to play random sounds.
* Spell linking based on conditions has been added. The table `spell_linked`
  now allows you to cast additional spells when a spell was cast based on a set
  of conditions.
* The table `scripted_event_id` has been renamed to `scripted_event`.
* `dbscripts_...` received a new command: `SCRIPT_COMMAND_TURN_TO` allows to
  turn creatures towards a target.
* EventAI received a new action: `ACTION_T_SUMMON_UNIQUE` which allows to
  summon a unique creature, which means the summon target can only be summoned
  once.
* The Scripting API has been streamlined to use more consistent function naming
  for all exported functions.

The following highlights the changes to the Scripting API:

* `isVendor` renamed to `IsVendor`

  unknown variables and flags with their proper values including spell families
  and item classes.
* A few compile time warnings have been resolved, as well as a number of
  possible security issues, thanks to @Coverity scanning service for OS
  projects!
* Spells rewarding spells, and/or casting spells on reward will now cast the
  proper spell. Also quest givers will be able to cast spells ignoring Mana
  requirements when they are out of combat on reward.
* Documentation for many parts of the source code has been extended.
* An issue in the realm list server has been fixed, where it would loose the
  connection to MySQL.

  of the targeted creature will be checked.
