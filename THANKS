The THANKS file:

All distributions should contain a `THANKS' file containing a two column list
of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically sorted. The left column gives
the contributor's name, while the right column gives the last known good email
address for this contributor. This list should be introduced with a wording
similar to this one:

 MaNGOS THANKS file

 MaNGOS has originally been written by Team Python and WoW Daemon Team. Many
 people further contributed to MaNGOS by reporting problems, suggesting various
 improvements or submitting actual code.

 Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

 Special thanks should also go out to the WowwoW team. We have gained help from
 them many times in the creation of this project. Keep up the good work guys.

 Thanks should also go out to the Ludmilla team, who are also providing the
 community with a great server. We have not gained too much help from them,
 but we have received some.

 Thanks to WCell team (especially Ralek) for reseach on realm reconnect sequence,
 item scaling stats algorithm, gameobject rotation issues.

 We would also like to acknowledge the contributions made by the following
 teams, those input and code has from time to time been included in the MaNGOS
 code. Each of the commits will have a prefix indicating the source team :-
